                    Hi! I am <strong>Suyash Bajpai</strong> (born 13 January, 1997), a final-year undergraduate student. I was introduced to programming in class 10th (Java being my first love XD). Although I will come out of college with a degree in Electronics and Telecommunications, the interest that I developed in programming has only deepened in these four years.

                    I have learnt everything about computer science with the help of resources available online (coursera, udemy, youtube). I was selected in <strong>Google Summer of Code</strong> this year and I spent the summer developing an open source Subtitle Synchronization tool for CCExtractor Development. <br />
                    It was a great learning experience which helped me understand the various aspects that come under the umbrella of software development. Under which comes programming (obviously :'D), research, planning, working in teams, handling pressures of deadline and much more. After that I have invested my time in more open source contributions and getting good grasp of data structures and algorithms. 
                    <br .>
                    My projects and the knapsack of my technical skills can be seen in my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tg7aofdkgswm3bfjJrjLmNwguPns7he0/view?usp=sharing">resume</a>.
