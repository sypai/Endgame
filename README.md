# Tasks

*   **Task 1: Git, HTML Tags**
  
  You are required to **clone** this repository and fix some minor stuff and send me pull-requests (Commit messages should be sensible)!  
  
  1.    There are some intended typos (spelling-mistakes), if you find them, correct them and send a pull-request. (IGNORE the lorem ipsum text!)
  2.    If you go through the HTML file, there are some unclosed tags (although it still works). Again, find them, close them, send them.

  You might want to go through the HTML file while keeping the final web-page opened along side to get a rough idea of how it all works.
