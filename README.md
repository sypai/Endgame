# Tasks

*   **Task 1: Git, HTML Tags**
  
  You are required to **clone** this repository and fix some minor stuff and send me pull-requests (Commit messages should be sensible)!  
  
  1.    There are some intended typos (spelling-mistakes), if you find them, correct them and send a pull-request. (IGNORE the lorem ipsum text!)
  2.    If you go through the HTML file, there are some unclosed tags (although it still works). Again, find them, close them, send them.
